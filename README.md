## Overview

This is the "Memory Game" project, a part of the Front End Web Developer Nanodegree program.

The program is a card-matching memory game using HTML/CSS and vanilla Javascript.

Just like in the classic game Memory, users click up to two cards to check if they are a match. If not, they
flip back down. If matched, they stay face up. The object is to complete the game in as few moves and/or
as little time as possible. When all cards are matched, the user wins and receives a congratulations message and an offer to play again.
