## Overview

This is the "Memory Game" project, a part of the Front End Web Developer Nanodegree program.

The program is a card-matching memory game using HTML/CSS and vanilla Javascript. Some fonts depend on internet connection for linked stylesheets.

Just like in the classic game Memory, users click up to two cards to check if they are a match. If not, they
flip back down. If matched, they stay face up. The object is to complete the game in as few moves and/or
as little time as possible. When all cards are matched, the user wins and receives a congratulations message and an offer to play again.
